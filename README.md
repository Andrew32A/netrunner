## Description

3D Unity game made in 1 week! This game is a movement based FPS game inspired by games like Titanfall, Carlson, Ghostrunner and Super Hot. The 3 key features I focused on during this project were movement, visuals, and a modular tutorial system. I wanted to make a game with controls that were snappy yet smooth with physics, had satisfying visuals and had interesting level design, and finally a tutorial system that would scale with player experience so both beginners and veterans could enjoy the game.
